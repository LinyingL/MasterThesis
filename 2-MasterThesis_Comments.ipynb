professor and economist asked more than 5,000 Americans how they thought wealth was distributed in the United States this is what they said they thought it was dividing the country into five RUF groups of the top bottom and middle three 20% groups they asked people how they thought the wealth in this country was divided then he asked them what they thought was the ideal distribution and 92% that's at least nine out of ten of them said it should be more like this in other words more equitable than they think it is now that fact is telling admittedly the notion that most Americans know that the system is already skewed unfairly but what's most interesting to me is the reality compared to our perception the ideal is as far removed from our perception of reality as the actual distribution is from what we think exists in this country so ignore the ideal for a moment here's what we think it is again and here is the actual distribution shockingly skewed not only to the bottom 20 percent and the next 20 percent the bottom forty percent of Americans barely have any of the wealth I mean it's hard to even see them on the chart but the top 1% has more of the country's wealth than nine out of ten Americans believe the entire top 20 percent should have mind-blowing but let's look at it another way because I find this chart kind of difficult to wrap my head around instead let's reduce the 311 million Americans to just a representative one hundred people make it simple here they are teachers coaches firefighters construction workers engineers doctors lawyers some investment bankers a CEO maybe a celebrity or two now let's line them up according to their wealth poorest people on the Left wealthiest on the right just a steady row of folks based on their net worth will colour-code them like we did before based on which percent quintile they fall into now let's reduce the total wealth of the United States which was roughly fifty four trillion dollars in 2009 to this symbolic pile of cash and let's distribute it among our 100 Americans well here's socialism all the wealth of the country distributed equally we all know that won't work we need to encourage people to work and work hard to achieve that good ol American Dream and keep our country moving forward so here's that ideal we asked everyone about something like this curve this isn't too bad we've got some incentive as the wealthiest folks are now about 10 to 20 times better off than the poorest Americans but hey even the poor folks aren't actually poor since the poverty line has stayed almost entirely off the chart we have a super healthy middle class with a smooth transition into wealth and yes Republicans and Democrats alike chose this curve nine out of ten people 92 percent said this was a nice ideal distribution of America's wealth but let's move on this is what people think America's wealth distribution actually looks like not as equitable clearly but for me even this still looks pretty great yes the poorest 20 to 30 percent are starting to suffer quite a lot compared to the ideal and the middle class is certainly struggling more than they were while the rich and wealthy are making roughly a hundred times that of the poorest Americans and in about ten times that of the still healthy middle class sadly this isn't even close to the reality here is the actual distribution of wealth in America the poorest Americans don't even register they're down to pocket change and the middle class is barely distinguishable from the poor in fact even the rich between the top ten and twenty percentile are worse off only the top ten percent are better off and how much better off so much better off that the top two to five percent are actually off the chart at this scale and the top 1% this guy well his stack of money stretches 10 times higher than we can show here's his stack of cash rhe stacked all by itself this is the top 1% we've been hearing so much about so much green in his pockets that I have to give him a whole new column of his own because he won't fit on my chart 1% of America has 40% of all the nation's wealth the bottom 80% 8 out of every 10 people or 80 out of these hundred only has 7 percent between them and this has only gotten worse in the last 20 to 30 years while the richest 1% take home almost a quarter of the national income today in 1976 they took home only nine percent meaning their share of income has nearly tripled in the last thirty years the top 1% owned half the country stocks bonds and mutual funds the bottom 50% of Americans own only half a percent of these investments which means they aren't investing they're just scraping by I'm sure many of these wealthy people have worked very hard for their money but do you really believe that the CEO is working three hundred and eighty times harder than his average employee not his lowest paid employee not the janitor but the average earner in his company the average worker needs to work more than a month to earn what the CEO makes in one hour we certainly don't have to go all the way to socialism to find something that is fair for hardworking Americans we don't even have to achieve what most of us consider might be ideal all we need to do is wake up and realize that the reality in this country is not at all what we think it is you\",\n          \"  foreign income inequality in the tarot Community as well as consumerism so I'm wading into this topic I don't know if it's smart of me to wait into these Waters but I'm going to wait in anyway so welcome if you're new here and if you are a returning visitor welcome back love to have you here so I was inspired this I'm a little late to the game I have to admit so apparently this discussion has been going on for a few weeks and I'm just new to the game I saw benabel wins blog post which I will link below which I thought was really great and then I saw mixtress raise video shout out to mixtures Ray and I saw her video about it and I saw a few other videos as well so I thought there were a lot of like really interesting opinions and I thought there was like good you know different perspectives on this type subject and this is a subject that come around every so often in the terror community and I think it's you know it's an important one to talk about I think it's it's good it's one of those things that you know we don't often you know we don't talk about it all the time but there's a reason that it comes back around every so often and I think particularly right now because we are living right now as I'm recording this in a time where we have really high inflation we have we're still in covert like covet is still a thing but we've we're out of like the lockdowns and stuff like that but you know those like 20 20 21 2022 were like really hard years and you know a lot of people were hit hard economically and now we have like inflation that's only making the Divide between the rich and the poor bigger and bigger so I think it's something that it's showing up not just in our community it's showing up in a lot of communities I think a lot of people are being affected by this and so I think it's it's important to you know talk about out these things so the first thing I think that I wanted to talk about was just how income inequality is a thing and you know I think in the past you know at least in the last decade or so we've been pretty like we're getting better we'll say it was not perfect but we're getting better about talking about some of the other inequalities things like sexism racism homophobia things like that right but we're not very good particularly in North America about talking about like class inequality and economic inequality and it's real and it is a big thing because it affects like all areas of your life and it cuts across like all of these different divides right you know if you have you know more money then you are you know you're able to make more choices you have more power you're able to you know just live a higher quality life than somebody who does not have as much money um and so I think we you know we we don't often talk about that particular inequality and yet it is such a big one it affects all of us in all communities so much so you know everybody you know when we look at tarotube there are people of all sorts of incomes all across the board right and you know if you were somebody that is on the lower end if you were not earning as much you do not have as many resources it can be a bit of a struggle because you can't afford the latest decks um you can't afford you know the most high-tech equipment to record things on and so you might feel somewhat Limited in what you can do you can't afford you know maybe high-tech software uh maybe you're working two or three jobs and you do not have the time to shoot lots of videos or to learn a whole bunch of new software and things like that so it really can affect a lot of different areas you know when I think specifically of how it might affect people in the tarot tube or spiritual witchy tube sphere so it can you know it already if you are thinking of it in that way you can see where those inequalities kind of start to come up and you know the person that has more spend money they're going to be able to acquire more decks and let's face it as much as people say oh I don't like consumerism it is the unboxing videos that tend to get the most views like it just is right because people want to see the deck and they want to see like is this something that I want to buy I love watching tarot unboxings because like I can't afford a lot of decks but sometimes I just like to see what's out there and just like to see you know what other people have and kind of what the art Trends are and things like that and I know that when I put on a Tarot unboxing on my channel it tends to do a little better than some of the other other videos that I do but I don't want my video my channel and that's a personal choice to just be unboxing videos and also quite felt like I can't afford that I I just don't have the money um and then you kind of get into this inequality thing where somebody who maybe can't afford to buy a lot of decks and so is getting more views because they're doing more unboxing videos they then often get sent decks for free to review and that can seem like really unfair when you're somebody who you know doesn't earn a lot of money in the first place um I you know any Publishers independent people if you were looking for someone to review your Dex I'm not going to be shy I would love to review Dax I mean I would never review anything I wasn't totally interested in I would you know if I had the choice of reviewing decks I would review Dex I was actually interested in but I don't begrudge people who have that opportunity because that would be awesome I have been sent I think three decks in the whole time I've been on tarotube to review and I'm really grateful for them um you know thank you and but every other deck that I have and I have an extensive collection was bought with my own money it was not sent to me and I think you know like when I am sent a deck and like I said it's only been three times I'm very clear that you know this this was sent to me so I I do not own a lot of Indie decks because a lot of people are talking about how expensive Indie decks are and how you know you have to be of a certain income to be able to afford them I only have five Indie decks five that's it like I could not uh take part in only 10 Indie decks because I don't have done any decks um you know when I have a little bit of money for tarot decks I can afford the mass market deck uh I can't afford you know the hundred dollar deck I have bought like I said I I have five Indie decks and I might do a video of which five Indie decks I have but the other thing is um I've been collecting tarot over years and years and years like decades now um and so I have an extensive collection but it's not like I'm buying decks all the time this is like I said it's over years that I've accumulated them and I'll go through times where I have more spending money and I like buy more and I'll have or times where I don't buy decks and it's not always necessarily about money sometimes there's just like not a lot of decks I'm interested in um at this time because like I said there's you know inflation is a thing and it's affecting people because everything has gone up like rents have gone up um like housing costs are like crazy um and you know I know it's different in different parts of the world but housing's gone up uh groceries like my grocery bill has increased in the last year by like 50 like it's nuts and it's people have dubbed it greed inflation because it's not like there's a real reason other than Greed for it to be going up that high like a little bit sure but not that High um and there's actually been like reports about how a lot of these bigger companies are seeing how much the consumer will take like how far they can push it so it is I could go it's a whole rant about that but I won't um but it's it's affecting everything down the line because if people are charging more for things like raw ingredients or for gas or whatever it's just like driving everything up so anyway the whole point of that was to say that people who already did not have a lot of extra income to spend on things like decks in order to make videos now probably have like even less spending money and I think some people are feeling that right and it can be hard when you see other people getting decks for free or buying lots of decks and you're like I don't know how to get eyes on my particular Channel because I don't have an unboxing video every week now I don't think you have to have an unboxing video all the time to get eyes on your stuff I think you know if you can't afford a lot of brand new decks then you know you might have to Branch out and talk about other things and I think it's good to have variety I mean I like unboxing videos but I don't want to just walk into unboxing videos like I like seeing lots of different content I like people talking about the different spreads they use I like people just like talking about tarot talking about you know the collection I already have or what decks they're deciding to sell or whatever like just I just like people talking about decks I guess whatever but I know everyone's different right but yeah I can see how it can be discouraging and you know there if this isn't just a thing that's affecting the tarot and the witchy Community because I see it in the goth community and I see it in the metal Community as well so like in the golf Community um if you don't have like you know you're not doing like outfits of the day and unboxing like the latest kill star you know haul and punk Rave and you know these you know beautiful makeup palettes you know it can be hard to make content because as much as God say goth is a music-based subculture I'm going to say something controversial goth was a music-based subculture when it started you know in like the late 70s early 80s and into the 80s it was about the music and it was very DIY it is not that way anymore if you go onto YouTube and you watch goth Channel videos it is rarely about the music it is almost always about the fashion it is very much an aesthetic based subculture as much as they like to deny it and that costs money it costs money to dress like that and with the metal Community metal is very much a music-based subculture I mean there is an aesthetic to it and you can get away in metal with not having a lot of money because you can get away with like a T-shirt and jeans but you can spend a lot of money on you know like leather and all this stuff but it you need money to like go to shows like we had Megan F come to town a week or two ago I couldn't afford to go like I just couldn't afford to buy the concert tickets uh concerts are so expensive um and I you know I first of all I was like you know what it's okay I've seen them I think like four times so I've seen them in their Heyday it's fine um but it's displayed like it's it's hard to not be able to participate and I think that there is like the fear of missing out um you know when we can't be part of these things where um you know where we can participate in tags like only 10 Indie decks or have unboxing videos all the time they can make people feel like they're missing out in the community it can also make people feel like bad about themselves because they're like I don't have as much as the other person and I think part of the problem is at least in North America and I think maybe Morrison United States I don't want to speak for it because I don't live in the states I live in Canada but you know correct me if I'm wrong my American friends but there is a prevailing notion I think especially North America that um you know money not just equals power but money also equals worth and that goes back to the idea of the Protestant work ethic there is sort of this myth that the harder you work the more money you will make and it doesn't always work like that like the CEO of a company does not work 300 times as hard as the janitor we know this but yet the CEO is paid 300 times what the janitor earns and you know but there's been this worth this myth of like if you don't have money that means that you're lazy or something is wrong with you and it used to be that poverty or income inequality was just seen as an economic condition but unfortunately it's been tied up more and more with value and worth and become a moral issue so and this has not been helped in the last 100 years or so with things like in some of the more extreme Evangelical movements there's this idea of the Prosperity Gospel where if if God if you're in God's favor God will bless you with um you know money and health and things will go well for you if you are sick or if you don't have money is because you're doing something wrong so that is one of the ideas that is gaining more and more traction in certain communities and you see a variation of that as well in sort of the new age Community which grew out of new thought from the earliest 20th century which has some of the same ideals and it argues that if you uh how you think is what you will get now positive thinking to a certain extent does work and it does help but is not everything and it doesn't erase other factors going on in someone's life so overall I think it's good to generally have a positive mindset but if you take it to the extreme of like if if I something bad happened I must have thought something bad I must have done something bad then what happens is you end up blaming people when they're in a you know like in a difficult condition or they're sick or they don't have money it's like well they must just thought bad thoughts so they didn't get it they didn't get what you know I don't have as much money as me they just need to like be more positive and that's as dismissive I think as the Prosperity Gospel and they're really rooted in kind of the same thing from the earliest 20th century but anyway that's a long story but basically it's led to this thing where we have kind of equated um money with worth and I think some people have internalized that myth and so it makes people not just feel like they're missing out but also like maybe there's something wrong if they don't have as much money as others and so I want to tell you that if you are don't have a ton of money to go out there and buy the decks and the books and go to the concerts and buy the fancy outfits you are just as worthy as somebody who can buy those things and if you are somebody that you know can't afford those things and does that's great enjoy them please do I don't begrudge you that please enjoy your decks and your outfits like it's great but I think that we have to stop equating economic like and the amount of money we have in the bank with you know how much we're worth as human beings the other thing to keep in mind is one thing that I learned in sociology and has just been reinforced uh with various things in my life is that a lot of people that appear to have money if they don't have money what they have is debt um there's a lot of people who will go out of their way to appear like they have money but they don't actually have money I remember hearing from somebody who worked for a luxury car dealership who said that 90 of the people who come in and you know buy a car or rent a car they do not have the money for it they get it on credit and a few months later the dealership ends up taking it back so a lot of people who want to appear like they have money don't actually have it and I think that's something important to keep in mind when you see somebody with a lot of stuff in any community that it only shows you a small picture you do not know what their financial status actually is and there are a lot of people walking around who aren't living within their means now I don't know anybody in this community who's doing that so I'm not not trying to say anybody is doing that but I just think generally in society that is something to keep in mind that you know appearances can be deceptive it's not always you know what exactly it appears to be so just just something to keep in mind then we have like people talking about the cost of Indie decks and because Indie decks are much more expensive than Mass Market decks I generally you know I don't go on Kickstarter I don't go looking around for them because I know I probably won't be able to afford it quite frankly um but you know I think that you know from a consumer perspective I can see why people are like these is so expensive I don't know if I can justify this purchase especially like I said with the economy being what it is and inflation I'm not going to spend my grocery money on a deck of cards like cards as much as I love Tarot cards they are not a necessity they are a luxury item and I want to tell you that if you do not have a large collection that's totally okay you really only need one deck yes I have a collection but I have accumulated this over time and you know if you have the money to spend on a collection and you want to that's okay too it's your money it's up to you to do what you want to do with it but I I just you know if you're somebody who's like oh I don't want to miss out and you end up spending money on that rather than the groceries please don't do that because you you deserve to eat and you know the decks will be there later and if you have done that in the past it's okay too because sometimes we all end up feeling like we're missing out right know that like if you have spent spent money and done that in the past that you know forgive yourself for that you know I think we all sometimes do that I think sometimes when I know in the past when I like haven't had money and I've gone through times in my life where I've like just been able to like pay my rent and eat um it's hard like seeing other people have things and then you're like I want it too and you feel left out and part of you it's like rebellious like I'm just gonna buy it anyway so I I know what that feels like so um be kind to yourself be kind to yourself from a Creator's end of things because for those of you that follow me you know that I work in the Arts um people don't value artists they don't they would never ask an accountant to work for free but people all the time say oh well it'll be good for exposure but you would never say that to a lawyer or an accountant would you no and people really devalue artists work and you know these days consumers are asking for more and more from tarot creators you know people want to have like the beautiful cardstock and they want it to be environmentally friendly you know or they went guilding or you know they want like a fancy book with a box or like they they want all these things and every time you have one of those things it adds to the cost of making it never mind making 78 individual pieces of art now especially if you are doing handmade art that is a lot of time so I once did a series of 50 paintings small paintings for a show it took me three years to make those paintings so when you're asking somebody to hand make 78 individual pieces of art that is a lot of time and a lot of work and people deserve to be compensated for that I can't talk about digital art because I'm not a digital artist I don't know about the effort that goes into that but I can speak from like a painter drawer perspective that it is a lot of time and a lot of work and so what happens too is when you are making an indie deck is a big Publishing House can afford to you know like the more print like the bigger the print run the smaller the individual cost for each deck is so they will print like hundreds thousands of decks and that's why they can charge less for it and they have wide distribution if you're an indie Creator you're probably only going to do a run of about 100 maybe 500 if you're super confident and so the individual cost of each unit is going to be higher and that's why people do kickstarters and things because it's really expensive to print that and then you don't even know if you're going to sell them all they might end up just sitting in your garage right so that's why the cost is so much higher and you have to make a profit to be able to justify all the time you spent making those cards in the first place so I do not begrudge artists for charging what they do and I think a lot of times people actually under charge and devalue their work so I don't begrudge people charging what they charge for the decks because I know a lot goes into it and I I don't like I feel like you know I don't if I can't afford a deck I guess I just say to myself well I can't afford it um and I just kind of move on I know some people are like I really really want that deck um and you know we I I there's a whole discussion too about uh what did they call them pirate decks right so my perspective on pirate decks is I'm not going to judge anyone else but I would personally never buy them and that is just because um again from an artist's perspective I think artists deserve to be paid for and I don't want to give money to a shyster to somebody who's ripping off someone else now I have accidentally bought a fake deck and I think it's probably happened to a lot of us I thought it was real it was on eBay um it was not a print deck it was a little bit you know it was it was cheap and that probably should have tipped me off I'm actually should do a whole video where I'm going to show you what deck I bought and telltale signs so that you know what a fake deck is as soon as the package came in the mail like before I even opened the package I knew it was fake because the package was too small um anyway it's the whole story but anyway if you've accidentally bought a deck don't beat yourself up there are you know shysters out there who like fool people um but if you know if you're going out in a little you're looking for those decks on purpose I'm not going to judge you I'm just going to say I would not personally do that because I would rather make sure that I pay the actual artist for their work but that is just me um and that is just my thoughts on that um you know I wonder what your thoughts are on all of this like what are your thoughts on income equality is that something we don't don't talk about enough what are your thoughts on Indie decks um what are your thoughts on mass Market decks speaking of mass Market decks they are getting expensive too like and again I can't I'm not mad because I know all the costs have gone up and so that Publishers are having to charge more but like a Luellen deck and this again this is a Canadian perspective um a Llewellyn deck you know in the bigger box used to be about 30 something dollars like two years ago they are now 50 to 60 dollars and so even the mass Market decks I'm taking a big pause on because I'm like oh that's a bit Steep and a bit pricey for where I am at right now um but I know in the states it tends to be like things tend to be a little bit cheaper I think it depends where you're in the world things like that but yeah like a lot of like even Mass Market decks are going up and like everything's costing more but our wages aren't going up you know that's it's that's gonna be an issue and not just in the terror world that's that's going to create issues down the line um but yeah like it's it's it's getting a little things are getting expensive out there what are your thoughts about it as long as the comments are respectful you don't have to agree with me as long as it's respectful I'll keep it but if you're like you know being disrespectful or disrespectful to other people in the comments I will delete it this is my channel I'm gonna I'll delete things if I think they are rude or disrespectful but you can for you to disagree um I know there's lots of different perspectives on this so I wonder what your thoughts are about this whole thing um I appreciate your

watching and as always peace and love thank you\",\n          \"  to understand how much the weakened estate tax which taxes wealth before it's inherited has been overlooked as a source of critical revenue for public programs you have to go back in time in 2011 the real news senior editor Paul Jay made a modest proposal for the state of Wisconsin C to find a 137 million by June and 3.6 billion by 2013 something has to give but why is it the public sector workers with the state running a deficit and state workers pension underfunded Jay offered an alternative to asking workers to make concessions which then Governor Scott Walker was proposing among them using an obscure levy that taxes estates which he said it fairly applied to the state billionaires could absorb much of the red ink here's a much easier way to raise the dough just go back to 2008 levels of state legislated estate taxes according to the Wisconsin Department of Revenue no state estate tax has been collected for deaths occurring on or after January 1st 2008 Wisconsin picked up a hundred and fifty eight point eight million in 2008 so if that tax were collected for 2009 and 2010 would be enough to fill the short-term hole and perhaps give those workers at Kohler mercury marine and harley-davidson a bit of a tax break Jay noted in the piece that the estate tax both on the state and federal level had been slowly dismantled and estate tax imposes a tax on wealth bequeath to future generations by taxing the value of the estate before it is inherited but the dilemma facing Wisconsin is a microcosm for the nation as conservatives have attacked the tax that many say is key to addressing the country's growing income inequality according to Matt Gardner from the Institute on taxation since 2001 Republicans have exponentially increased the exemption after which in a status taxed in 2001 all of the estate after six hundred thousand dollars was taxed at a rate of 50% but since Republicans started dismantling it no tax is imposed up to ten million dollars meaning only one in 1,000 estates qualify for the tax the estate tax operates in a larger framework though it's best understood as a backstop to the federal income tax and part of the reason why continuing to have an estate tax is so vital is that as long as it exists it is at least a backstop against rampant tax avoidance on the personal income tax this graphic shows how undermining the tax has all but eliminated revenues from the estates of the wealthiest it's a weakening of a critical source of revenue that could hamper the government's ability to provide services for decades but it's also a vehicle to create a permanent class of uber rich and the damage is not limited to the federal revenues the undermining of the taxes also affected state budgets with nearly 30 states eliminating the estate tax altogether since 2001 in 2001 when Congress has substantial estate debts they pretty much ripped up the agreement between the federal government and the state government and took away this implicit aid to state governments what that meant was that state government suddenly faced the choice if they wanted to have an estate tax it was all coming out of their own state residents pockets and that made the idea of having a state estate tax much less popular and within 5 years something like 2/3 of all the states repealed their estate taxes so now I think we're left with roughly one third of the states that have any estate tax revenue at all in fact the Federal Joint Committee on taxation calculates the latest cuts to the state tax will cost the US Treasury 269 billion dollars over the next decade as Gardner notes this tax break helps people who have inherited their wealth in fact a 2012 analysis by the group United for a fair economy found that 40 scent of American billionaires inherited a sizable asset from a spouse or family member Morris pearl chairman of the group patriotic millionaires says it's another conservative effort to create a regressive tax system and it does not get enough attention look at the you know the list from Forbes of the richest people in the country eight of the top couple dozen are people who have simply inherited wealth that the heirs to Sam Walton started Walmart in the heirs to Forrest Mars who started Mars candy and those are people who don't pay taxes at all because they don't have any income those are people who don't pay capital gains tax because they only buy American law they only pay tax on the the increase in wealth after their patriarch died and other than the estate tax essentially no tax at all and yeah it does lead to an aristocracy which is why Morris and his fellow millionaire say the estate tax should be strengthened not just so the rich can pay their fair share but to restore equity to a tax system that punishes the poor while the rich get richer when people can get a return on capital when capital is paying more than working for a living that inevitably will get more inequality because the rich people will continue getting richer and richer and richer and leaving the rest of the people behind this is taya Graham and
