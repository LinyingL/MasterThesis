It is wrong that women are making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men. \\n\\nIt is wrong that we are the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee paid family and medical leave, or that all of our people do not have health care as a right. And when people begin to look at those issues, they begin to exchange establishment thinking. And when people begin to look at these issues, they say: you know what this is the United States of America. We can do better. \\n\\nWhat this campaign is about is telling you that. no president, not Bernie Sanders or anybody else can transform this country in the way we need. Change all by himself can't be done by one person, because the powers that be on Wall Street and corporate America, in the corporate media, in wealthy campaign contributors, these folks are so powerful that no one president could do it alone. What we need, and what this campaign is about is a political revolution. \",\n          \"Most people have no clue about how severe wealth inequality has become in America and how much worse it's getting. There's a YouTube video by user paulit Zane, where he references a study done by a Harvard Economist and professor, and the study asked 5 000 Americans how they believed wealth was distributed in the United States. \\nThe group was first asked what they thought the wealth distribution in America looked like dividing up American Wealth into five segments. \\nThe participants came up with the following: a bar chart that looks like this, with the top 20 owning a little bit more than half of the nation's wealth and the bottom 20 owning just a sliver of wealth. No more than five percent. Participants were then asked what they thought the ideal distribution should be. Over 9 out of 10 participants said it should look something like this: slightly more. \\nEqually distributed, but the top 20 percent, of course, still own quite a bit of the nation's wealth. Before I show you what the actual distribution looks like, many of you might actually point out that hey, this YouTube video was done like a decade or 12 years ago. \\nSurely the answers could have changed since then, but the reality is that human behavior and thought process seldomly changes that quickly. \\nAnswers have stayed pretty consistent, even though time has passed. In fact, in 2020, CBS did a morning show where they asked random Mall shoppers what they thought wealth distribution in America looked like with pumpkin pie. The pie was to represent total American household wealth and it was cut into 10 slices. The subjects were then asked to distribute those 10 slices into the same five segments. The usual distribution they chose looked like something in this picture. \\nThis person allocated most of the pie to the middle class. In fact, all the subjects during that segment displayed similar results to that of the original study done by the original video. That goes to show you that there's still a huge misconception about how wealth is actually distributed within the United States among its own citizens. \\nOkay, so the actual distribution looks like this: the top 20 percent of Americans own over 80 percent of the nation's total wealth. The bottom 20 and the next 20 percent, so the 21st to 40th percentile, barely even register on this bar chart, and the middle class makes up less than five to six percent of the overall bar. \\nThis should be startling to you, and what's even more crazy is how much the top one percent actually has in terms of wealth. The top one percent has more wealth than. what most Americans think the top 20 percent should have. But still that doesn't really put the top one percent into its full context, which the original video from 2012 did really well. \\nIn that video, the original Creator took all 340 million Americans and reduced them down to a representative 100 people. He then ordered them from left to right, poorest on the left, riches on the right, and put them on a scale with each 10 percent representing a different percentile of wealth, taking total household wealth in America and reducing it down to a pile of symbolic cash. He then spread it Out Among the 100 representative Americans. \\nThis is what Americans want. The wealth distribution to look like this looks pretty healthy. The poverty line is way over here on the left and even though people are poor, they aren't in quote poverty the middle class. has the bulk of the wealth here and the wealthy owned just slightly more than the middle class. \\nThere's a smooth transition of wealth across the board here, but we all know that it's a lot worser than this is the distribution of how Americans think wealth is spread out. In the United States, about five percent of the poor are now living in poverty. The wealthy definitely have a lot more than the middle class here, making about 10 times more than them and up to 100 times more than the poorest Americans. \\nIf you were to ask most people if this is acceptable, they'd probably say no. However, this still isn't the reality of How It's actually distributed. So here's what reality looks like. On that same scale, the poverty line is now moved up to 11,6 percent, with 37,9 million people living in poverty the. \\nCensus defines that as making less than 1.760 dollars per year, or about 35 dollars per day for a single per person under the age of 65. The middle class here is very hard to differentiate from the poor, and the richest people have so much wealth that it's hard to even comprehend. They don't even fit on the screen. \\nBut what's even harder to comprehend is just how much more money the top one percent holds in wealth compared to the rest of the nation. And what I want to accomplish in this video is show you how big that disparity is and how much it's actually changed since 11 years ago. According to recent Federal Reserve data, the top one percent of all Americans own a whopping 31 percent of the nation's wealth. \\nThat's 43,94 trillion dollars of the nation's 140 trillion dollars of wealth, the. top one percent is defined as those having a net worth of over 11,1 million dollars, and because they are so wealthy, the scale of them might be pretty hard to comprehend. In fact, we had to make a separate column just for them foreign. \\nIf we expand our parameter slightly, the top 10 percent owns 69 percent of the wealth of the entire nation, while the remaining 90 of people own just 31 or a third of the nation's wealth. What that means is that the majority of wealth close to 70 percent is concentrated in the hands of few. What's even crazier is that the bottom 50 owns just 3,44 trillion dollars of wealth. \\nThat means the entire bottom half of the population in the United States owns just a mere 2,45 percent of the entire nation's wealth. The crazier part, though, is that even. though you think that's bad. That's actually an improvement. Since 2012, or the bottom 50 percent just owned 0,87 percent of the nation's wealth. \\nThat means the bottom half of the population has nearly doubled their total household wealth since 2012, but that doesn't really matter, because the top one percent also grew their wealth considerably. It's important to understand how wealth inequality has changed, because that Gap has certainly widened over the years. \\nAccording to the organization for economic cooperation and development, they conducted a 2018 study on wealth inequality across 28 industrialized countries, and one of their primary findings was the following quote out of the five countries for which several observations are available: wealth inequality increase in the U S and the UK since the Great Recession in 2008. These changes are associated with falling home prices, lower rates of home ownership, but higher prices of. \\nFinancial assets and the recovery benefiting the top of the distribution. With that being said, let's take a look at wealth distribution within the United States from 1989 to 2012, all the way to 2023. \\nIn 1989, the distribution in the United States looked closer to this. The top one percent owned 22 percent of the nation's wealth still quite a lot, but nowhere near what they own today. \\nThe top 10 percent in its entirety owned 60 percent of the nation's wealth and the remaining 90 percent owned 40 percent, the bottom 50 percent. They only own 3,79 of the wealth. In 2012, when that video was published, the distribution looked like the following: the top 10 percent owned 67,96 or 68 percent of the nation's wealth, rounding up, and the remaining 90 now own 32 percent of the wealth, so in about a quarter of a. \\nCentury the wealthiest 10 percent. They started to own eight percent more wealth, while the bottom ninety percent owned eight percent less wealth. We can see that the Gap clearly started to widen around that time. \\nBut now here's what that looks like in 2023. The top 10 now owns 69 of the nation's total wealth, with the remaining owning 31. That means in just a decade the Gap has widened even more, with one percent more wealth going towards the top 10 percent and one percent less for the remainder. \\nLet's look at the top 10 wealth and just look at how it's changed from 1989 to 2012 to 2023.22,67 of the wealth in 1989 went to the top 10 percent. That number changed to 29,13 in 2012 and now 31,26 percent of the nation's wealth is concentrated among the top one percent. Now I'm. no statistician here, but this trend is clearly disheartening. One thing I was wondering was: how do other countries fare? \\nAre they seeing the same trends that we are seeing, or are they seeing their wealth Gap you know, decreasing? \\nWell, that same study from 2018 looked at 28 other countries like Denmark, Germany, Canada, Japan and Italy, and it found that the wealth disparity in the United States is unrivaled by any other industrialized country. On average, across all of these Global countries, the top 10 percent would own 52 percent of their respective Nations wealth. \\nThis is considerably different from what we experience here in the United States, so much so that the United States is a crazy outlier among other countries. Looking at this graph, the most offending countries in terms of wealth inequality would be the Netherlands and Denmark, after the United States. But you can. still see that United States here is a clear outlier. \\nOne of the biggest reasons I think the United States has such a wealth disparity between the top one percent and the rest of the population is due to the fact that in the US we have the sheer most amount of billionaires that live here. \\nAccording to Forbes, the United States has the highest number of billionaires with 735 publicly listed billionaires, followed by China with 698 billionaires in India, with 237. Germany and Russia complete the top five countries with 136 and 117 billionaires respectively. According to the fact checking website 8 Snopes, 735 billionaires in the United States collectively held over 4,5 trillion dollars of wealth at the end of 2022. That's more than the entire bottom 50 of All American households. \\nLet that sink in. This type of wealth is incomprehensible to the human mind. in fact, if we just took the average net worth of all of these billionaires, so you just took the sum of their total wealth, divided by 735, each billionaire on average would own about 6,1 billion dollars in net worth. \\nThat's 11.000 times the amount of a family in the bottom 50 net worth and 555 times that of someone who just broke into the top one percent with a net worth of 11,1 million dollars. That's right. Your average billionaire is 555 times more richer than someone who just hit the top one percent, and those top one percenters were already 200 times richer than those in the bottom 50 percent. \\nBillionaire wealth has always been a controversial Topic. In fact, I made a video back in 2020 about Jeff bezos's wealth in rice, and usually the tension does go towards these individuals like Jeff. Bezos or even Elon Musk. Let's actually take a look at Elon musk's total net worth of 248 billion dollars and let's try to put it into perspective. The New York Times did a fascinating article about a year ago on Jeff bezos's wealth. \\nThey did a bunch of cool visualizations, but this was back when Jeff Bezos was the number one richest guy in the world. But since Elon now holds that title, let's actually do the same visualizations, just in Elon terms. \\nShall we this right here is a Toblerone chocolate. The height of one of these is about 1,05 inches tall. \\nLet's pretend for a moment that the height of this Toblerone chocolate represents the median wealth of a household in the United States, or about 12.700. We can then start stacking toblerone's one on top of each other, just like so that means this. stack of three would represent about 365 thousand dollars of total wealth. \\nAnd if we kept stacking these toblerones all the way up and up and up and up, how tall do you think we would have to stack these toblerones to get to Elon musk's wealth? Well, let me tell you, Elon musk's net worth would stretch upwards all the way to the height of Mount Everest. Yeah, that's right. Mount Everest 2.000 feet, but not just one Mount Everest. \\nMaybe two Mount Everest, you might say nope, not even two Mount Everest. The answer is seven Mount everests tall. You'd have to climb Everest seven times to get the equivalent net worth of Elon Musk, where the median net worth was the height of this piece of chocolate. Fascinating. This is an Oreo. It measures about 1,7 inches in diameter. It also represents the median net. \\nWorth of someone in America at 12.700. You probably know where I'm going with this, but three of these cookies across would be 5,25 inches, which is a pretty good size, but it's also worth about 16.000 in net worth in our example. \\nSo if each of these cookies represents the median wealth of an American at 1,75 inches, or 12.700 in Media Net worth for the American household, how many of these would need to be laid side by side to get to Elon musk's net worth? Well, you need about 2 33.607 of these cookies laid side by side. \\nTo put that into perspective, we would need to go super wide, in fact as wide as the Grand Canyon, not just once, not just twice, but three separate times. Three separate times. That is very fascinating and you know what wealth here. we've got. Lastly, here's my favorite depiction of Elon musk's wealth. Let's visualize it with this cube of 1 billion dollars. \\nIt has a height of 45 feet, a width of 48 feet and a length of 40 feet. This cube is already huge, but let's see how far Elon musk's wealth literally Stacks up to find out how much he has, because this level of wealth is still difficult to comprehend for any human brain. \\nTo do so, we'll lay the cubes horizontally across and then compare them to the global landmarks if they were laid down on their side. As we go through famous landmarks, we can see that we're passing the Eiffel Tower, which is about 21 billion dollars worth of cash stacked high. In making this video, I unfortunately don't have a good Solution on how to reduce wealth inequality, hopefully shedding some light on the. \\nProblem helps bring some awareness and that you appreciate this video. Our country's wealth is a double edged sword. For those that can generate wealth, it's one of the greatest things imaginable. However, it does seem that the majority of people, if you're not born within that category of wealth such as the top one percent, it is extremely hard to ascend to those ranks. \\nAt the end of the day, the American dream is still live, but it does come with the cost of wealth inequality.

Peace, foreign. \",\n          \"inequality, which I would-I would point to-it's a multifaceted thing, but I would point to the relative stagnation of incomes for people at the lower end of the income spectrum and also lower mobility.  \\nSo those are things that hold back our economy.  \\n\\nThey are.  \\n\\nThe thing is, we don't really have the tools to address those.  \\n\\nWe have interest rates and bank supervision and financial stability policy and things like \\nthat, but we can't-we can't get at those things through our tools.  \\n\\nWhen we lower the federal funds rate, that supports the economy across a broad range of people \\nand activities.  \\n\\nBut we can't-we don't have the ability to target particular groups.  \\n\\nNotwithstanding that, we do talk about it because these are important features of our economy. \\n \\n\\nAnd we-you know, I think those are-those distributional issues are issues that are really \\nfor our elected officials.  \\n\\nAnd I would say I take them seriously as holding back our economy.  \\n\\nThe productive capacity of the economy is limited when not everyone has the opportunity, has \\nthe educational background, and the healthcare, and all the things that you need to be an active \\nparticipant in our workforce.  \\n\\nSo I think we can, if we want to have the highest potential output and the best output for our economy, \\nwe need that prosperity to be very broadly spread in the longer run.  \\n\\nAnd I, again, I would just say the Fed, you know, We can talk about those things a lot.  \\n\\nAnd when we think about maximum employment in particular, we do look at individual groups. \\n \\n\\nSo the high unemployment in a particular racial group, like African-Americans, we would look \\nat that as we think about whether we're really at maximum employment.  \\n\\nWe would look at that along with a lot of other data.  \\n\\nSo the answer is, we do look at all those things and do what we can with our tools.  \\n\\nBut ultimately, these are issues for elected representatives.  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Relevance\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Re\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"index\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 76,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 274,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 245,\n        \"samples\": [\n          25\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 18,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2022\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"month\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 116,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2014-04\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

And when people begin to look at those issues, they begin to exchange establishment thinking.

We can do better. \\n\\nWhat this campaign is about is telling you that. no president, not Bernie Sanders or anybody else can transform this country in the way we need. Change all by himself can't be done by one person, because the powers that be on Wall Street and corporate America, in the corporate media, in wealthy campaign contributors, these folks are so powerful that no one president could do it alone. What we need, and what this campaign is about is a political revolution. \",\n          \"Most people have no clue about how severe wealth inequality has become in America and how much worse it's getting. There's a YouTube video by user paulit Zane, where he references a study done by a Harvard Economist and professor, and the study asked 5 000 Americans how they believed wealth was distributed in the United States. \\nThe group was first asked what they thought the wealth distribution in America looked like dividing up American Wealth into five segments. \\nThe participants came up with the following: a bar chart that looks like this, with the top 20 owning a little bit more than half of the nation's wealth and the bottom 20 owning just a sliver of wealth. No more than five percent. Participants were then asked what they thought the ideal distribution should be. Over 9 out of 10 participants said it should look something like this: slightly more. \\nEqually distributed, but the top 20 percent, of course, still own quite a bit of the nation's wealth. Before I show you what the actual distribution looks like, many of you might actually point out that hey, this YouTube video was done like a decade or 12 years ago. \\nSurely the answers could have changed since then, but the reality is that human behavior and thought process seldomly changes that quickly. \\nAnswers have stayed pretty consistent, even though time has passed. In fact, in 2020, CBS did a morning show where they asked random Mall shoppers what they thought wealth distribution in America looked like with pumpkin pie. The pie was to represent total American household wealth and it was cut into 10 slices. The subjects were then asked to distribute those 10 slices into the same five segments. The usual distribution they chose looked like something in this picture. \\nThis person allocated most of the pie to the middle class. In fact, all the subjects during that segment displayed similar results to that of the original study done by the original video. That goes to show you that there's still a huge misconception about how wealth is actually distributed within the United States among its own citizens. \\nOkay, so the actual distribution looks like this: the top 20 percent of Americans own over 80 percent of the nation's total wealth. The bottom 20 and the next 20 percent, so the 21st to 40th percentile, barely even register on this bar chart, and the middle class makes up less than five to six percent of the overall bar. \\nThis should be startling to you, and what's even more crazy is how much the top one percent actually has in terms of wealth. The top one percent has more wealth than. what most Americans think the top 20 percent should have. But still that doesn't really put the top one percent into its full context, which the original video from 2012 did really well. \\nIn that video, the original Creator took all 340 million Americans and reduced them down to a representative 100 people. He then ordered them from left to right, poorest on the left, riches on the right, and put them on a scale with each 10 percent representing a different percentile of wealth, taking total household wealth in America and reducing it down to a pile of symbolic cash. He then spread it Out Among the 100 representative Americans. \\nThis is what Americans want. The wealth distribution to look like this looks pretty healthy. The poverty line is way over here on the left and even though people are poor, they aren't in quote poverty the middle class. has the bulk of the wealth here and the wealthy owned just slightly more than the middle class. \\nThere's a smooth transition of wealth across the board here, but we all know that it's a lot worser than this is the distribution of how Americans think wealth is spread out. In the United States, about five percent of the poor are now living in poverty. The wealthy definitely have a lot more than the middle class here, making about 10 times more than them and up to 100 times more than the poorest Americans. \\nIf you were to ask most people if this is acceptable, they'd probably say no. However, this still isn't the reality of How It's actually distributed. So here's what reality looks like. On that same scale, the poverty line is now moved up to 11,6 percent, with 37,9 million people living in poverty the. \\nCensus defines that as making less than 1.760 dollars per year, or about 35 dollars per day for a single per person under the age of 65. The middle class here is very hard to differentiate from the poor, and the richest people have so much wealth that it's hard to even comprehend. They don't even fit on the screen. \\nBut what's even harder to comprehend is just how much more money the top one percent holds in wealth compared to the rest of the nation. And what I want to accomplish in this video is show you how big that disparity is and how much it's actually changed since 11 years ago. According to recent Federal Reserve data, the top one percent of all Americans own a whopping 31 percent of the nation's wealth. \\nThat's 43,94 trillion dollars of the nation's 140 trillion dollars of wealth, the. top one percent is defined as those having a net worth of over 11,1 million dollars, and because they are so wealthy, the scale of them might be pretty hard to comprehend. In fact, we had to make a separate column just for them foreign. \\nIf we expand our parameter slightly, the top 10 percent owns 69 percent of the wealth of the entire nation, while the remaining 90 of people own just 31 or a third of the nation's wealth. What that means is that the majority of wealth close to 70 percent is concentrated in the hands of few. What's even crazier is that the bottom 50 owns just 3,44 trillion dollars of wealth. \\nThat means the entire bottom half of the population in the United States owns just a mere 2,45 percent of the entire nation's wealth. The crazier part, though, is that even. though you think that's bad. That's actually an improvement. Since 2012, or the bottom 50 percent just owned 0,87 percent of the nation's wealth. \\nThat means the bottom half of the population has nearly doubled their total household wealth since 2012, but that doesn't really matter, because the top one percent also grew their wealth considerably. It's important to understand how wealth inequality has changed, because that Gap has certainly widened over the years. \\nAccording to the organization for economic cooperation and development, they conducted a 2018 study on wealth inequality across 28 industrialized countries, and one of their primary findings was the following quote out of the five countries for which several observations are available: wealth inequality increase in the U S and the UK since the Great Recession in 2008. These changes are associated with falling home prices, lower rates of home ownership, but higher prices of. \\nFinancial assets and the recovery benefiting the top of the distribution. With that being said, let's take a look at wealth distribution within the United States from 1989 to 2012, all the way to 2023. \\nIn 1989, the distribution in the United States looked closer to this. The top one percent owned 22 percent of the nation's wealth still quite a lot, but nowhere near what they own today. \\nThe top 10 percent in its entirety owned 60 percent of the nation's wealth and the remaining 90 percent owned 40 percent, the bottom 50 percent. They only own 3,79 of the wealth. In 2012, when that video was published, the distribution looked like the following: the top 10 percent owned 67,96 or 68 percent of the nation's wealth, rounding up, and the remaining 90 now own 32 percent of the wealth, so in about a quarter of a. \\nCentury the wealthiest 10 percent. They started to own eight percent more wealth, while the bottom ninety percent owned eight percent less wealth. We can see that the Gap clearly started to widen around that time. \\nBut now here's what that looks like in 2023. The top 10 now owns 69 of the nation's total wealth, with the remaining owning 31. That means in just a decade the Gap has widened even more, with one percent more wealth going towards the top 10 percent and one percent less for the remainder. \\nLet's look at the top 10 wealth and just look at how it's changed from 1989 to 2012 to 2023.22,67 of the wealth in 1989 went to the top 10 percent. That number changed to 29,13 in 2012 and now 31,26 percent of the nation's wealth is concentrated among the top one percent. Now I'm. no statistician here, but this trend is clearly disheartening. One thing I was wondering was: how do other countries fare? \\nAre they seeing the same trends that we are seeing, or are they seeing their wealth Gap you know, decreasing? \\nWell, that same study from 2018 looked at 28 other countries like Denmark, Germany, Canada, Japan and Italy, and it found that the wealth disparity in the United States is unrivaled by any other industrialized country. On average, across all of these Global countries, the top 10 percent would own 52 percent of their respective Nations wealth. \\nThis is considerably different from what we experience here in the United States, so much so that the United States is a crazy outlier among other countries. Looking at this graph, the most offending countries in terms of wealth inequality would be the Netherlands and Denmark, after the United States. But you can. still see that United States here is a clear outlier. \\nOne of the biggest reasons I think the United States has such a wealth disparity between the top one percent and the rest of the population is due to the fact that in the US we have the sheer most amount of billionaires that live here. \\nAccording to Forbes, the United States has the highest number of billionaires with 735 publicly listed billionaires, followed by China with 698 billionaires in India, with 237. Germany and Russia complete the top five countries with 136 and 117 billionaires respectively. According to the fact checking website 8 Snopes, 735 billionaires in the United States collectively held over 4,5 trillion dollars of wealth at the end of 2022. That's more than the entire bottom 50 of All American households. \\nLet that sink in. This type of wealth is incomprehensible to the human mind. in fact, if we just took the average net worth of all of these billionaires, so you just took the sum of their total wealth, divided by 735, each billionaire on average would own about 6,1 billion dollars in net worth. \\nThat's 11.000 times the amount of a family in the bottom 50 net worth and 555 times that of someone who just broke into the top one percent with a net worth of 11,1 million dollars. That's right. Your average billionaire is 555 times more richer than someone who just hit the top one percent, and those top one percenters were already 200 times richer than those in the bottom 50 percent. \\nBillionaire wealth has always been a controversial Topic. In fact, I made a video back in 2020 about Jeff bezos's wealth in rice, and usually the tension does go towards these individuals like Jeff. Bezos or even Elon Musk. Let's actually take a look at Elon musk's total net worth of 248 billion dollars and let's try to put it into perspective. The New York Times did a fascinating article about a year ago on Jeff bezos's wealth. \\nThey did a bunch of cool visualizations, but this was back when Jeff Bezos was the number one richest guy in the world. But since Elon now holds that title, let's actually do the same visualizations, just in Elon terms. \\nShall we this right here is a Toblerone chocolate. The height of one of these is about 1,05 inches tall. \\nLet's pretend for a moment that the height of this Toblerone chocolate represents the median wealth of a household in the United States, or about 12.700. We can then start stacking toblerone's one on top of each other, just like so that means this. stack of three would represent about 365 thousand dollars of total wealth. \\nAnd if we kept stacking these toblerones all the way up and up and up and up, how tall do you think we would have to stack these toblerones to get to Elon musk's wealth? Well, let me tell you, Elon musk's net worth would stretch upwards all the way to the height of Mount Everest. Yeah, that's right. Mount Everest 2.000 feet, but not just one Mount Everest. \\nMaybe two Mount Everest, you might say nope, not even two Mount Everest. The answer is seven Mount everests tall. You'd have to climb Everest seven times to get the equivalent net worth of Elon Musk, where the median net worth was the height of this piece of chocolate. Fascinating. This is an Oreo. It measures about 1,7 inches in diameter. It also represents the median net. \\nWorth of someone in America at 12.700. You probably know where I'm going with this, but three of these cookies across would be 5,25 inches, which is a pretty good size, but it's also worth about 16.000 in net worth in our example. \\nSo if each of these cookies represents the median wealth of an American at 1,75 inches, or 12.700 in Media Net worth for the American household, how many of these would need to be laid side by side to get to Elon musk's net worth? Well, you need about 2 33.607 of these cookies laid side by side. \\nTo put that into perspective, we would need to go super wide, in fact as wide as the Grand Canyon, not just once, not just twice, but three separate times. Three separate times. That is very fascinating and you know what wealth here. we've got. Lastly, here's my favorite depiction of Elon musk's wealth. Let's visualize it with this cube of 1 billion dollars. \\nIt has a height of 45 feet, a width of 48 feet and a length of 40 feet. This cube is already huge, but let's see how far Elon musk's wealth literally Stacks up to find out how much he has, because this level of wealth is still difficult to comprehend for any human brain. \\nTo do so, we'll lay the cubes horizontally across and then compare them to the global landmarks if they were laid down on their side. As we go through famous landmarks, we can see that we're passing the Eiffel Tower, which is about 21 billion dollars worth of cash stacked high. In making this video, I unfortunately don't have a good Solution on how to reduce wealth inequality, hopefully shedding some light on the. \\nProblem helps bring some awareness and that you appreciate this video. Our country's wealth is a double edged sword. For those that can generate wealth, it's one of the greatest things imaginable. However, it does seem that the majority of people, if you're not born within that category of wealth such as the top one percent, it is extremely hard to ascend to those ranks. \\nAt the end of the day, the American dream is still live, but it does come with the cost of wealth inequality.

Peace, foreign. \",\n          \"inequality, which I would-I would point to-it's a multifaceted thing, but I would point to the relative stagnation of incomes for people at the lower end of the income spectrum and also lower mobility.  \\nSo those are things that hold back our economy.  \\n\\nThey are.  \\n\\nThe thing is, we don't really have the tools to address those.  \\n\\nWe have interest rates and bank supervision and financial stability policy and things like \\nthat, but we can't-we can't get at those things through our tools.  \\n\\nWhen we lower the federal funds rate, that supports the economy across a broad range of people \\nand activities.  \\n\\nBut we can't-we don't have the ability to target particular groups.  \\n\\nNotwithstanding that, we do talk about it because these are important features of our economy. \\n \\n\\nAnd we-you know, I think those are-those distributional issues are issues that are really \\nfor our elected officials.  \\n\\nAnd I would say I take them seriously as holding back our economy.  \\n\\nThe productive capacity of the economy is limited when not everyone has the opportunity, has \\nthe educational background, and the healthcare, and all the things that you need to be an active \\nparticipant in our workforce.  \\n\\nSo I think we can, if we want to have the highest potential output and the best output for our economy, \\nwe need that prosperity to be very broadly spread in the longer run.  \\n\\nAnd I, again, I would just say the Fed, you know, We can talk about those things a lot.  \\n\\nAnd when we think about maximum employment in particular, we do look at individual groups. \\n \\n\\nSo the high unemployment in a particular racial group, like African-Americans, we would look \\nat that as we think about whether we're really at maximum employment.  \\n\\nWe would look at that along with a lot of other data.  \\n\\nSo the answer is, we do look at all those things and do what we can with our tools.  \\n\\nBut ultimately, these are issues for elected representatives.  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Relevance\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Re\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"index\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 76,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 274,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 245,\n        \"samples\": [\n          25\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"video_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 221,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"PT8M55S\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
